  title: "sendit"
  subtitle: A flexible traffic generator for **HTTP**, **browser**, **DNS**, and **WebSocket** targets. Polite by design — every request is paced, rate-limited, and resource-gated before dispatch.

  title: Key features
  subtitle: sendit runs across all four major web protocols with configurable pacing and built-in courtesy limits so it never hammers targets or the local machine.

  items:
    - title: Four driver types
      icon: hub
      description: Send real traffic over **HTTP/HTTPS**, headless **browser** (chromedp), **DNS** (miekg/dns), and **WebSocket** — all from one config file.

    - title: Three pacing modes
      icon: schedule
      description: "**human** (random delay), **rate_limited** (token bucket), and **scheduled** (cron windows) — traffic that looks exactly like you want it to."

    - title: Polite by design
      icon: shield
      description: Per-domain token buckets, decorrelated jitter backoff on errors, and CPU/RAM resource gates ensure sendit never overwhelms targets or your machine.

    - title: Graceful shutdown
      icon: stop_circle
      description: Waits for all in-flight requests to complete on SIGINT/SIGTERM before exiting. No dropped results.

    - title: Hot reload
      icon: refresh
      description: Send SIGHUP (or run `sendit reload`) to atomically swap targets, weights, and rate limits without restarting the process.

    - title: Prometheus metrics
      icon: bar_chart
      description: Optional Prometheus scrape endpoint exposes request counts, error rates, latency histograms, and bytes read — all labelled by driver type.
